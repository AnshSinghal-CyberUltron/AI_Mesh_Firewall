# AGENTS.md — AI Mesh Firewall

## MCP Hardening BACKSTOP changelog
- Parallel Claude + Cursor sessions harden the multi-tenant MCP gateway. **Every hardening change is
  logged to four memories in the SAME commit:** Ruflo (`mcp__ruflo__memory_store`
  namespace=`mcp-hardening/changes` + `hooks_notify`), this file (one-line pointer), Cursor
  (`.cursor/rules/mcp-hardening-changelog.mdc`), and the canonical `docs/mcp/HARDENING_CHANGELOG.md`
  (source of truth; §0 = protocol + entry template).
- Backstop work-list: `scripts/ralph/mcp_hardening_scratchpad.md` (G0–G7, one item/iteration).
- Shared index: stage narrowly, commit immediately, never `git add -A`; rebase from `main` often.
- Changelog pointers (newest last):
  - CHG-0001 (2026-07-02) — established the four-memory changelog protocol; audited runsc fail-closed
    enforcement in `docker_manager._resolve_runtime()`.
  - CHG-0002 (2026-07-02) — backstop audit → `docs/mcp/BACKSTOP_FINDINGS.md` (24 findings; next priority =
    G2 item 2 fail-closed byte-verified result redaction). Confirmed SSE egress unscanned, per-actor authz
    missing on stdio/ws, tags audit-only, gVisor/egress default fail-open, a dead cross-tenant oracle +
    15-sandbox ceiling overstating prior "scale validated" claims.
  - CHG-0003 (2026-07-02) — G2 item 2 (partial): `_scan_tool_result_floor` now fails CLOSED on result-scan
    error (was fail-OPEN, forwarding raw RESULTS). +2 byte-level tests; 323 passed. Remaining: SSE
    buffer-and-scan, string/structuredContent shapes, main-path inline audit.
  - CHG-0004 (2026-07-02) — G2 item 2 (closes HIGH SSE leak): `ext_mcp_proxy` now buffers+scans finite
    tools/call SSE results (`_scan_reframe_sse_tool_result`), re-emits masked or blocks; non-tools/call SSE
    passes through. 12 + 342 tests pass; aidefence oracle confirms clean egress. Remaining: string/
    structuredContent shapes, main-path inline audit.

## Ralph autonomous loop — gateway hardening
- Backlog + status live in scripts/ralph/prd.json; learnings in scripts/ralph/progress.txt.
- ONE story per iteration; never break a passing gate; never mark passes:true without a green gate.
- Backend gate: `cd gateway && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest ai_mesh_gateway/tests -q` (+ `./.venv/bin/python
  -m pytest tests/leakhunt` for leaks — build that suite under gateway/tests/leakhunt; +
  test_openai_sdk_compat.py for SDK). Frontend gate: `cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build`
  plus dev-browser verification for UI stories.
- Security invariants are non-negotiable: egress bytes are the only source of truth; any redact/block
  verdict or assume_redacted attestation must be byte-verified; fail closed on a no-op scrub.
- Reuse responses_adapters.py error helpers; respect patterns.py false-positive protection; mirror the
  output-guard honesty check onto the input/egress path.
- UI-story gate (D*): the durable re-runnable gates are `scripts/playwright_*.mjs`. Run with
  `NODE_PATH="$PWD/tests/e2e/node_modules" BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8180 node scripts/playwright_<story>.mjs`
  — playwright lives in `tests/e2e/node_modules`, NOT `frontend/`. They drive the LIVE docker stack
  (Vite :8180 → control :8100 → gateway :8300); login admin@zeroshield.io / Adm1n!Pass#2024 via the REAL
  form (localStorage-token injection alone does NOT establish a session — the AuthContext guard bounces to
  /login). Module-1.1 is telemetry-heavy: keep panel/login waits ≥60s so a slow-but-correct render is not a
  false failure; never lower an assertion to make a flaky gate pass.
